# In Search of Proust

## Description

This is an app for Marcel Proust lovers around the world. *In Search of Lost Time* is a collection of books that are of great importance to me in the sense that they have added a layer of depth in my understanding of the world around me. They are filled with philosophy, a great sense of humour and are just a great companion for anyone navigating life.
One of the many aspects  I love in the books is the depiction of places, which is why one of the features of the app is to represent a map containing places mentioned in the books. To this will be added pop ups with context around each place and quotes from the books.
Characters and their intricate identities are also a source of fascination, which is why I intent to have a 'which character of *La Recherche* are you?' based on a few questions asked to the user. 
I am also building a 'Proust in Loo' function which allows you to get a random page from the book when looking for something quick to read (hence the name)
This project is being built using React.js and I am using the skills acquired during the 16-week edX Skills bootcamp in Front-End Web Development that I just completed.

## Deployment

I have not yet decided which web host service is best suited for this app but will continue to update this README when I reach that point.
